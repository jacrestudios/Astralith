      <h1>Adventure Background</h1>
      <p><span class="big">A</span>n ominous sign has appeared in the sky above the Kingdom of Astralith: a bright blue light that shines day and night.  A prophecy long ago told of a devastating meteor that would strike the land, destroying all life in the vicinity.  The Kingdom is based around deep lakes and valleys from previous impacts, lending credence to the prophecy's truth.</p>
      <p>On council from the Archmage, the King has enacted martial law in order to build a device to save the Kingdom from the meteor, but in doing so has started to lose control of some his stronger generals who seek to make warlords of themselves.  </p>
      <p>The sudden change in law and siezing of property has sparked discontent among the people and a rebellion has broken out.  The Choice Alliance has formed to install a new democratic government and belives the meteor is a ruse by the King to strengthen his power. </p>
      <p>The Merchant's Guild has been perturbed by the King's acts and seeks to use the rebellion as a chance to free themselves from taxes.  However, as a contingency to the meteor strike, the Guild is also building a massive fleet to move their wealth to a distant land.  </p>
      <p>The Church of Bahamut is also disappointed in the King taking council from the Archmage over them.  They believe the meteor can be stopped, but only by divine intervention by one of Bahamut's chosen.</p>
      <p> Meanwhile a Cult of Lathander has started to take root in the area amongst the chaos, challenging the teachings of the Church.  Rumors are the cult has been around for a long time and are only now surfacing with new intentions.</p>
      <p>Foreign agents and mercenaries also roam the land seeking to sabotage the Kingdom's attempts at preservation.  Some say that every faction may be infilitrated by outside forces.</p>
      <div><img src="AstralithCities.jpeg"></div>
	  <h3>The Kingdom of Astralith</h3>
      <p>The Kingdom spreads across four major regions where powerful factions have set up: The bay of the Shattered Lands, the mines along the Great Lake of Orton, the craggy hills of Skragrikt, and the alpine lands of Northlock.  It is said that the bay and two great lakes of the region, as well as the great mountains that surround them, were formed from the impacts of meteors that twisted the continent.</p>
      <p>The current dynasty came from the islands of the Shattered Lands spurring the ire of the land dwelling populace who already felt subjugated prior to the King's new proclamation of martial law.  Now with the new order to sieze people and supplies, and the outbreak of an organized rebellion, many of the villages are harboring fugitives in solidarity against the King though each has a different reason for wanting to defect.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h4>The Shattered Lands</h4>
      <p>This bay is composed of a number of resource rich islands which dominate maritime trade in the area.  Using their knowledge and wealth from foreign lands, they eventually spread out across the region, conquering the areas that now make up the kingdom as a prophecy to spread wherever the meteors struck.  In this area lie the Capitol, the Archmage's Citadel and the Church Basilica.</p>
      <p>The Shattered Lands are extremely diverse, having sailors and traders of all lands travelling the region, but Dragonborn nobles lead the area in wealth and prominence, using public duels to eliminate any who challenge them.</p>
      <p>Honor and Fate are two important concepts to the people of the Shattered Lands, so of the many who do not go into trade become devoted clerics in the church, educated wizards at the Office, or great fighters in the army.</p>
      <h4>Great Lake of Orton</h4>
      <p>The high peaks thats surround the trade city of Orton contain precious metals that have made the city the richest in the Kingdom.  The city is on the shore of a massive lake which feeds to the Shattered Bay via the Diamond River, alongside which runs the Iron Road.</p>
      <p>Dwarves dig deep into the mountains, extracting the ore for which the city is named, while elves, halflings, and humans fish the lake and provide transport for the dwarven riches.  It is here that the Merchant's Guild was founded and where their great bank is hidden.  Those that come from this area who do not like to toil in the mines, on the fishing ships, or at accounting desks find themselves employed as thieves, assassins, mercenaries or entertainers.</p>
      <h4>Hills of Skragrikt</h4>
      <p>This land is made up of harsh hills covered in cooled lava.  It has been mostly been occupied by communal tribes who subsist through hunting and gathering.  The fairly recent establishment of rule from the Shattered Lands has always been resisted, especially with the peoples of this land being subjugated by the Red General.  With the king's new order, this has emboldened the hill tribes to unite and establish a new state.</p>
      <p>The hills are full of those who value their freedom, but also understand the bond of a tribe.  Humans, orcs, dragonborn, among others all inhabit these lands and usually devote themselves to scouting the lands as rangers, the barbaric art of war, or channeling their natural magical powers that seem inherit to the hills.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h4>Northlock</h4>
      <p>The alpine lake is the furthest land in the kingdom.  Covered in a massive glacier and steep forested mountains, this area has become home to ascetics who seek refuge from the world.  Unfortunately the high passes of the mountains are used by raiders, requiring those who are normally peaceful to take up arms, as they get no support from the kingdom despite taxation.</p>
      <p>The forests and mountains tend to be occupied by Gnomes, Dwarves and Halflings among others who seek a place to focus or find isolation from civilization.  Those who occupy this area often become warrior monks, clerics, and rangers.</p>
      <p>With the rebellion and the Church's disapproval of the Archmage, as well as their lack of defense from the Kingdom from mountain raiders, the Monasteries have united to create a new state with the Church as their head, welcoming rebels who need refuge.</p>
      <h3>The Office of the Archmage</h3>
      <p>The Office was established in order to research arcane phenomenon that could benefit the Kingdom.  It was under the first Archmage that the Scepter of Power was first found and used to consolidate the Kingdom's hold over the land.  Many hopeful wizards, clerics and sorcerors flock to the Office in order to get bureaucratic jobs with the Kingdom.  Devotion to administrative and research opportunities advance those admitted, giving many an objective approach to promotion which drives Officers.</p>
      <p> At the head of the Office is the Archmage, a personal attendant to the king and powerful wizard.  The rest of the hierarchy of the Office is purposely vague and layered with many titles that don't seem to impart any authority over another.</p>
      <h3>The Merchant's Guild</h3>
      <p>The meteor impacts in the area have left it rich in precious minerals, which the Dwarves mine from the lake regions prosperously.  Using their wealth they have developed a series of trading posts known as the Iron Road which extends from the lake to the bay for overseas shipping.  From there anyone driven towards the sea helps the Guild transport their goods.  </p>
      <p>Mercenaries, spies, assassins and other underground trades secretly fuel the power of the Guild, who ultimately want to create any sort of government who gives them free trade.  To this effect, they wish to use the rebellion to install a new parliament which they hope to make ineffective through nonsense procedural rules that deadlock any true law.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="page">
    <div class="column">
      <h3>The Warlord Generals</h3>
      <p>While the Capitol is the center of power, the army has become increasingly loyal to those that lead them in these turbulent times.  Given the new implementation of martial law, the Generals have decided to consolidate their power, extorting extra labor and materials for their own gain, conscripting people into their armies, and fortifying personal kingdoms.  Currently the army is split between the White General in the Capitol, the Red General in Skragrikt, and the Golden General in Orton.</p>
      <h4>The White General</h4>
      <p>The army of the Capitol is led by the White General named after his devotion to the Church as a paladin and as a white Dragonborn.  He is beginning to doubt the King's judgement after his choice to take council from the Archmage instead of the Church.</p>
      <p>The White General's army is made up of devoted and faithful warriors who reluctantly believe that their oppression of the people is for a greater good.</p>
      <h4>The Red General</h4>
      <p>The people of Skragrikt have been oppressed by the Red General, a powerful necromancer who enslaves prisoners of war, even after death.  He plans on establishing his own kingdom on the eastern side of the hills, using the tribes as labor to build up great port cities.</p>
      <p>Only the most deranged and homicidal warriors follow the Red General into battle, so his army is mostly supplemented by the undead and carrion animals.</p>
      <h4>The Golden General</h4>
      <p>Orton is effectively governed by the Golden General whose army of assassins and thugs ensures that all taxes get paid and then some.  He wants to use the rebellion as a reason to arrest the main leaders of the Merchant's Guild, but the assassins of both factions are at a stalemate.</p>
      <p>The Gold General's army is made up of the ultra secret as well as the extremely forward, anyone who is motivated by a paycheck and scared of their throat being slit.</p>
      <h3>The Chosen Alliance</h3>
      <p>"All must choose."  This is the motto of the new organized rebellion across the kingdom, who want to establish a democratic rule after the army began to conscript people and take materials.  It began in Skragrikt and quickly spread across the region, receiving influence from multiple sources.</p>
      <p>The rebellion currently seeks to free those taken by the army by attacking them when invading villages, raiding labor camps, and generally undermining the army's power.  They still seek an opportunity to force the King to concede to their government demands, but are not established enough to outright challenge his domain.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3>The Church of Bahamut</h3>
      <p>The Dragonborn of the area believe the meteors are signs of Bahamut's fury, and so were driven to enact justice on those inhabiting the lands struck by ancient meteors.  With their conquest they spread their rituals and beliefs, their faith strengthened by their fortune in expanding their kingdom.</p>
      <p>The Church is a powerful, almost parallel government within the Kingdom, holding strong sway over the King, army, and people.  The rise in the Archmage's power under the current king has caused tension between the factions.</p>
      <h4>Bahamut's Champion</h4>
      <p>In honor of the great dragon god, a giant censer burns a special blend of materials during an annual festival.  The heat from this censer rises to that of a furnace, which the Church uses to melt gold and create a seal which is bestowed upon a champion of Bahamut in great honor.</p>
      <h3>The Cult of Lathander</h3>
      <p>Among all the peoples of the kingdom, some have started to believe that the meteor is a fated reset of the sinful kingdom.  It currently seems to be spread through peaceful grassroots movements, but unknown leaders are starting to build an army of the faithful to enact a grander plan.</p>
      <h3>Saboteurs from Afar</h3>
      <p>The kingdom's maritime strength has always sparked fierce competition from foreign forces.  Among hearing of the prophecy, it seems that foreign agents have been invading the land in order to ensure the Kingdom's doom, through the meteor, rebellion, or other plans.</p>
      <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
      <p><span class="big">T</span>he village of Farhill is the Northernmost village along the Red Road, a trade and military route used by the infamous Red General who terrorizes the region of Skragrikt.  The adventure starts here as the general's forces are currently gathering everyone together for conscription under the king's new order, given the blue light in the sky.</p>
      <p> Whatever reason the player has for being at this town, they have been forced out of their domicile to stand before the Red General and his forces.  Gathered around with you are the other inhabitants of the town, including traders, farmers, craftsmen, clergyman and some mercenaries.</p>
      <p>Surrounding everyone are a small force of unruly-looking soldiers holding back a group of barking and snarling dogs. Here he asks them whether they will choose to serve the King under his army, or who considers their work essential enough to remain in the village and take care of others.</p>
